# HireSense – Recruiter-Friendly Hiring Intelligence

## 🎯 Project Idea
HireSense is a smart hiring intelligence platform designed to help recruiters filter and rank candidates faster.  
It parses resumes, extracts skills, matches them with job descriptions, and provides ranked insights so HR can make quick and informed decisions.

## 🛠️ Problem Solved
Recruiters often receive 1000+ resumes for a single job.  
Manual filtering is time-consuming and error-prone.  
HireSense solves this by:
- Automating resume parsing
- Ranking candidates instantly
- Providing transparent insights for decision-making
- Saving recruiter time and effort
