# HireSense – Recruiter-Friendly Hiring Intelligence

## 🎯 Project Idea
HireSense is a smart hiring intelligence platform designed to help recruiters filter and rank candidates faster.  
It parses resumes, extracts skills, matches them with job descriptions, and provides ranked insights so HR can make quick and informed decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Resume Parsing (Apache Tika/POI)
- Skill Extraction & Heatmap Visualization
- Candidate Ranking with Match Score
- Dynamic Weight Adjustment for Skills
- Secure Authentication (Spring Security + JWT)
- Modern UI (React + Vite + Chart.js)

---

## 🛠️ Problem Solved
Recruiters often receive 1000+ resumes for a single job.  
Manual filtering is time-consuming and error-prone.  
HireSense solves this by:
- Automating resume parsing
- Ranking candidates instantly
- Providing transparent insights for decision-making
- Saving recruiter time and effort

---

## 📅 Day-wise Process

### Day 1
- Created GitHub repository and initialized README.md  
- Added `HireSenseBackend` (Spring Boot) and `HireSenseFrontend` (React Vite) folders  
- Defined clean folder structure for backend (controller, service, repository, model, config)  
- Documented project vision and workflow in README.md
